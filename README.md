## Launch
You can either look at the work done on the [`SAT_nQueens_PERRIER.html`](SAT_nQueens_PERRIER.html) file or in the [`SAT_nQueens_PERRIER.ipynb`](SAT_nQueens_PERRIER.ipynb) which you can use and execute on colab.

## The project
A brief explanation of the choices I've made and the different steps I've been throught during this project are detailled in the [`TP_SAT_nQueens_PERRIER.pdf`](TP_SAT_nQueens_PERRIER.pdf) file.
